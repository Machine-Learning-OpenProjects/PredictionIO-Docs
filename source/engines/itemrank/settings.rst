====================================
Item Rank: Engine Settings
====================================

You can specify the following settings on the web admin panel.

* Item Types Settings

  * Selected Item Types

    If you have more than one type of item data in your app, you can limit an engine to access certain type(s) of items.
    This feature is useful especially when you want different engines to handle the recommendation of different types of items.

* Recommendation Preferences

    * Freshness

      Specify whether the engine should give priority to newer items in its top N ranking. A value of 0 to 10. 10 means you prefer newer items the most.

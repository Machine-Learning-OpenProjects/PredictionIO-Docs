Item Recommendation: Evaluation
===============================

This engine comes with a evaluation metrics for you to compare the performance of algorithms and parameter settings on your prediction problem.
It uses a portion of the collected data to simulate test data. Evaluation is conducted offline.

Mean Average Precision
----------------------  

Mean Average Precision (MAP@k) evaluates the prediction accuracy of the top k recommendations for users. The higher the score, the better the algorithm is.
To learn more about MAP@k, please read `Information Retrieval <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval>`_.

====================================
Item Similarity: Built-in Algorithms
====================================

A standard PredictionIO installation, which includes the Apache Mahout library, comes with the following algorithms:


Mahout's Item Similarity Collaborative Filtering (Single Machine / Distributed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Estimate similarity between items based on previous behavior of users on these
items.


Random Rank (Single Machine / Distributed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suggest items randomly. (As a baseline algorithm for evaluation purposess)


Latest Rank (Distributed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suggest latest items as the most similar items. (As a baseline algorithm for
evaluation purposes.)

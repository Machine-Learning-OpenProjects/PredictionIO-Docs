====================================
Item Similarity: Built-in Algorithms
====================================

A standard PredictionIO installation, which includes the Apache Mahout library, comes with the following algorithms:


Mahout's Item Similarity Collaborative Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Estimate similarity between items based on previous behaviors of users on these items.

Scalding Item Similarity Collaborative Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Mahout's approach, this algorithm is implemented in Scalding.


Random Rank
~~~~~~~~~~~

Suggest items randomly. (see it as a baseline algorithm for evaluation purposes)

Latest Rank
~~~~~~~~~~~

Suggest latest items as the most similar items. (see it as a baseline algorithm for evaluation purposes)

Prediction Serving
==================

With a predictive model, you can query prediction results from an engine through RESTful APIs/SDKs.

Depends on the engine type, you can retrieve batch-processed results or real-time results with various filtering and ranking options.
For specific details, please refer to the documentation of API Endpoints of each engine type.

System Design of PredictionIO
=============================

System Components
------------------

PredictionIO consists of a few components:

* Admin Server
* IO Server
* Prediction Stack
 
Admin Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PredictionIO's Admin Server component provides a web interface for developers to manage applications, engines and algorithms.

IO Server
~~~~~~~~~

IO Server offers scalable REST API services to communicate with your web or mobile app. 
It is responsible for handling data input and prediction output. 

Prediction Stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Built on top of solid data frameworks and technology, such as Hadoop, Cascading, Scalding and Mahout, 
PredictionIO can handle a huge amount of data efficiently. A variety of machine learning algorithms are available for you to implemenet with just a few clicks.
